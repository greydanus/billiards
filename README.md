# The Billiards RL Environment

[Blog post]() | [Paper]() | [Colab notebook]()

This is a simple billiards RL environment. It is written in pure NumPy. It runs at about 330 frames per second on a 2013 MacBook Air which is comparable to or a bit faster than the OpenAI Atari emulator running on the same machine. This means it's running fast enough to train a deep learning agent on. And one could almost certainly make it faster via different tricks.

The goal of this environment is to study the planning abilities of RL agents. After all, billiards is a game where one simply must do some sort of planning in order to be successful.
